# 🔆 Photocell

Automatic ambient brightness adjustment can be achieved by installing a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). This simple sensor changes resistance with light levels, allowing the ESP32 to measure surrounding brightness and adapt the display accordingly.

Most common LDRs work well when paired with a reasonably sized fixed resistor. They are inexpensive and widely available from hobby and electronics suppliers (e.g. [CdS photoresistor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/161) and [Through-Hole Resistors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2892)).

A **10 kΩ resistor** is a good starting point, but for best results check the LDR's datasheet and select a value that matches the typical daylight conditions where the device will operate.

For a clean installation, the LDR can be placed inside a standard LED cap (e.g. [LC5-8](https://www.toby.co.uk/led-and-light-pipes/led-mounts-and-spacers/lc3-and-lc5-valcon-3mm-and-5mm-led-lens-caps/)) so it mounts neatly in the device chassis and remains visually discreet.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Sensor reading

Any analog input pin can be used, but those on the ADC1 channel are preferred.

> Avoid strapping pins as this pin is biased. On ESP32 (LX6-based, original series) boards, the ADC2 channel pins are not supported.

[secrets.h](https://github.com/VIPnytt/Frekvens/blob/main/firmware/include/config/secrets.h) example:

```h
#define PIN_LDR 1 // Signal
```

## 🧩 Extension

With the [Photocell](https://github.com/VIPnytt/Frekvens/wiki/Extensions#-photocell) extension enabled, the device automatically adjusts display brightness to match ambient light throughout the day.
