# 🧰 Tools

Optional utilities that are not considered part of the core functionality but may be useful to advanced users.

Installation of Python dependency packages:

```bash
pip install tools/
```

## ✂️ Animation splitter

Separates `.csv` files from the [animations](https://github.com/VIPnytt/Frekvens/wiki/Modes#-animation) mode into individual frames. These can then be used as [drawing](https://github.com/VIPnytt/Frekvens/wiki/Modes#-draw) templates or streamed to the device.

## 🌡️ Home thermometer demo

Demostration script for the [Home thermometer](https://github.com/VIPnytt/Frekvens/wiki/Modes#%EF%B8%8F-home-thermometer) mode. Useful for simple testing, but a more permanent smart-home integration setup is encouraged.

## 💻 Stream csv

Remotely stream `.csv` files from the [Animation](https://github.com/VIPnytt/Frekvens/wiki/Modes#-animation) or [Draw](https://github.com/VIPnytt/Frekvens/wiki/Modes#-draw) modes to the device via the [Stream csv](https://github.com/VIPnytt/Frekvens/wiki/Modes#-stream) mode.
